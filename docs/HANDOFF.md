# Build Handoff — start here

The "you are here, do this next" doc for a session picking up the build cold.
Design rationale lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md); this is state +
next steps only.

**Read order:** this doc → `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `README.md` →
[`FLASHING.md`](FLASHING.md) → [`PROJECT_BRIEF.md`](PROJECT_BRIEF.md).

**Repo:** https://github.com/underminedsk/baskets-lights · `pio test -e native`
(**93 pass**) and all four device envs (`devkitc` / `firebeetle` / `field-*`)
build clean. Latest on `main` (2026-07-05): **runtime power schedule is
code-complete** — Operations can set light-sleep/radio check interval,
deep-sleep check interval, LED-on window, and force-awake override. The conductor
persists that `PowerPolicy` and broadcasts it in every beacon; performers apply
it without further firmware changes. This bumps `VERSION` to `0.2.0` and
`PROTO_VERSION` to 5, so all boards must be reflashed together before the live
bench can use it. Photodiodes are now optional/fallback, not the main sleep
strategy. Previous latest: **release version display for OTA
safety is code-complete** — firmware reports `VERSION` in addition to protocol,
git-derived build id, and dirty flag; the Operations/detail UI shows the human
version and links the commit hash to GitHub. Previous latest: **OTA
safety foundation hardware-verified** — all three bench boards were flashed to
`PROTO_VERSION 3` build `c046bf54` with dirty=false; `/api/state` reports
`summary.firmware.consistent=true`, `matching=2`, `expected=2`, and the
Operations tab shows `2 / 2 on this build`. REGISTER carries protocol +
git-derived build id + dirty flag in that verified build, and the machine state
exposes conductor/per-node firmware identity so mixed firmware is visible before
OTA transfer exists. Previous latest: **real control plane on the bench** —
the FastAPI UI/API can now talk to the conductor over USB serial using
newline-delimited JSON while preserving the human CLI. Hardware-verified with
one conductor + two performers: `/api/state` sees both performers, map placement
works, and Pattern tab changes ack through the real conductor. The Pattern tab
now has per-pattern controls: Pulse/Glow use hue, Sweep uses period+wavelength,
and Palette Drift uses period+spatial spread. Same-session review fixes moved
blocking serial calls off the FastAPI event loop and cleaned WebSocket disconnect
handling. Previous latest: **review-debt paydown** — the
host-unreachable logic extracted out of `main.cpp` into pure tested headers
(`macaddr.h`, `table_wire.h`, `bootplan.h`, `patternBootSafe`), `field-*` build
envs (`-D HEARTBEAT_LED=0`), and the table rebroadcast stretched 5 s → 60 s
steady-state with **targeted single-row replies to needy REGISTERs** (the
initial new-MAC-burst design was replaced the same day after an 8-angle
adversarial review confirmed three delivery holes in it — see "Self
code-review" below). Before that: **INA228
power-telemetry firmware (code-complete, host-tested, 8-angle-reviewed — built
ahead of the chip, see "INA228 power telemetry" below)**,
Stage-A radio duty-cycle (measured), **Stage-B CPU light-sleep
(hardware-verified on bench 2026-07-03)**, **Lever-2 daytime deep-sleep
(code-complete, default off, awaiting the pilot phototransistors)**, a
full-repo adversarial self-review with all 5 correctness findings fixed, the
production BOM, and the **pilot-batch order placed 2026-07-03** (most parts
arrive Mon Jul 6, batteries Jul 10 — see "Pilot batch: ORDERED" below).

## ▶ Next session: pick up here (updated 2026-07-05)

Priority order:
1. **Hardware-verify runtime power schedule:** after committing/flashing v5 to
   all boards, use Operations to set a short LED-off window + short deep-check
   interval, confirm performers clear LEDs/deep-sleep/rejoin, then use
   "Turn boards on" to force the field awake. Keep recent-serial grace in mind:
   USB-connected boards intentionally stay awake for 5 min after serial input.
2. **Next OTA slice:** manual maintenance-mode OTA only, field-wide only, no
   selected-node updates. Start with the non-writing control flow: enter/exit OTA
   window, readiness/status reporting, timeout, and UI copy. Do not implement
   autonomous/opportunistic updates.
3. **Optional negative OTA-safety check:** if useful, intentionally flash one
   performer with a same-v5 but different build and confirm it appears as
   `Firmware mismatch`; restore all boards to one build afterward. Protocol-v2
   or older boards simply vanish from the roster due to the version gate.
4. **Monday (parts in hand):** phototransistors are no longer required for the
   main sleep strategy. Treat them as optional/fallback only. Wire INA228 on one
   reference node (SDA→21, SCL→22, chip in series between
   battery+ and buck input) → run the INA228 bench checklist below → first
   real Wh integral; first flash of the `firebeetle` env on real FireBeetle
   hardware. **Plus one new 2-minute check:** with the conductor up and a
   table row assigned, `erase_flash` + reflash a performer and confirm it
   re-adopts its position within ~10 s of registering (the new single-row
   `[table]` reply; code-reviewed + host-tested but the radio path itself
   isn't hardware-verified yet).
4. **User task, anytime (needs hands + DMM):** re-measure the 12 V
   battery-side draw with naps running, **USB disconnected** (USB backfeeds the
   5 V rail and corrupts the reading) — quantifies the Stage-B win vs the old
   51 mA rest / 55 mA avg numbers. Same scene for apples-to-apples: amber GLOW
   @ bri 48.

## Where the build is right now

**Done & hardware-verified** (Milestones 1–2 → symmetric-role refactor → rainbow +
pattern persistence → protocol foundation Half 1 & 2 → battery go/no-go + worst-case
power measurement):
- **One firmware image for every node** (`src/main.cpp`); role is a runtime NVS
  value (default performer), set over serial. Build envs: `devkitc`, `firebeetle`,
  `native`, plus `field-devkitc` / `field-firebeetle` — identical firmware with
  `-D HEARTBEAT_LED=0` (the onboard blink is invisible inside an opaque lantern,
  burns LED current, and caps every Stage-B nap at 500 ms). Bench flashes keep
  the heartbeat; flash `field-*` for deployment.
- **Sync:** conductor broadcasts a clock beacon; performers lock an offset and
  render against synced time; **free-run on missed beacon** (no blackout), re-lock
  on return. Verified: `LOCKED`, stable offset ~±100 µs, `gaps=0`.
- **Patterns** (`f(x,y,t)`): `PULSE` (uniform breathing), `PALETTE_DRIFT` (smooth
  rainbow hue cycle; `params[0]`=period ms, `params[1]`=spatial hue offset ×100 so
  the rainbow travels or runs in unison), `SWEEP` (1-D traveling wave), and
  `SOLID` (`pattern 3`: every pixel full RGBW — the worst-case power draw, for
  bench-measuring the LED ceiling). Conductor broadcasts the pattern
  (`pattern_id`/`brightness`/`params[4]`); performers render it. Every node
  hard-clamps brightness to `MAX_BRIGHTNESS` (config.h, **192**) so no pattern can
  exceed the per-node power budget (see the worst-case measurement below).
- **NVS identity:** `id` + `(x,y)` persist across reboot; set over serial.
- **Pattern config persists** too: `pattern_id`/`brightness`/`params` survive a
  power-cycle (keys `pat`/`bri`/`p0`..`p3` in the `"node"` namespace).
- **Control plane serial bridge + UI** (hardware-verified 2026-07-05): FastAPI
  serves the static operator UI and HTTP/WS API; `JsonLineSerialConductor`
  talks to the conductor over pyserial with request ids and ok/error acks.
  Mutations currently implemented: identify ack, assign/place, forget,
  replace, pattern changes, and blackout. Serial calls are serialized and run
  off the FastAPI event loop, so one serial timeout does not block unrelated
  async work. The UI has Map, Node List, Patterns, and Operations views; map
  zoom/pan, drag-to-move/place, unpositioned tray, single bottom-sheet actions,
  per-pattern controls, and field firmware consistency display are all wired.
- **Protocol foundation Half 1** (hardware-verified): typed message header
  `{magic, version, type}` with type dispatch; **MAC identity** read at boot and
  shown in `info`; **bidirectional ESP-NOW** — performers unicast `REGISTER`
  every 10 s and the conductor builds a **MAC-keyed roster** (`roster` command).
  Sync hot path unchanged (still `LOCKED gaps` flat after the rework).
- **Protocol foundation Half 2** (hardware-verified): **conductor-authoritative
  `MAC→(x,y)` layout table** in NVS, broadcast as chunked `MSG_TABLE`; a node finds
  its row, adopts its `(x,y)`, and caches it (survives reboot, no laptop needed).
  Conductor edits it with `assign <mac> <x> <y>` / `table` / `forget <mac>`.
  Verified: a node took a position set only on the conductor, no serial to it.
- **GPIO2 heartbeat** blinks on the synced beat (zero-wiring sync check).
- **Serial commands:** `info`, `roster` / `table` / `assign` / `forget`
  (conductor), `role conductor|performer`, `id <n>`, `pos <x> <y>`,
  `pattern <n>`, `bri <n>`, `param <i> <v>`, `powersave on|off`,
  `dusk on|off` (performer; daytime deep-sleep, default off),
  `wake on|off` (conductor; FIELD_AWAKE beacon flag, summons dusk-sleeping
  nodes; same force-awake bit as the Operations override), `power` / `power reset` (INA228 nodes; print / zero the energy
  accumulators). Note diag output is gated: it prints only within **5 min of
  serial input** — hit Enter in a monitor to revive a quiet node (see
  FLASHING.md). Exception: the conductor's `[power]` telemetry log is
  deliberately ungated (it's the overnight audit trail).
- **Wire protocol is v5** (`PROTO_VERSION 5`; BEACON now includes runtime
  `PowerPolicy`, and REGISTER includes release version, protocol, build id, and
  dirty flag for OTA version consistency).
  Protocol-mismatched nodes silently reject each other — **flash every board
  together**. A same-protocol stale version/build is reported as
  `Firmware mismatch`.
- **Host unit tests** (`test/test_logic/`, 93): sync core, pattern math, roster,
  layout table, radio duty-cycle, nap scheduler (Stage B), dusk detector +
  fail-awake gates (Lever 2), pattern static-ids + boot-guard, glow warm-hue
  color, power telemetry (conversions / plausibility gate / report scheduler),
  MAC text parsing, table wire (chunking / length validation / own-row scan /
  row-reply decision + builder), firmware version consistency, power-policy
  schedule math, and boot classification.

**Hardware-verified (2026-06-28) — Milestone 3, Lever 1, Stage A (performer radio
duty-cycle):** a performer powers the radio **down** between brief listen windows
and keeps rendering from the synced clock, attacking the RX-dominated night draw.
Logic is the dependency-free `include/powersave.h` (5 host tests): a state machine
that holds the radio ON to acquire the first beacon, then cycles `DUTY_LISTEN_US`
ON (600 ms, spans ~2 of the 4 Hz beacons) / `DUTY_OFF_US` OFF (4 s) — ~13% radio
duty. `main.cpp` does the teardown/bring-up (`radioSleep`/`radioWake`:
`esp_wifi_stop`/`start`, re-adding the broadcast peer + recv-cb and re-flagging the
conductor unicast peer on each wake), gates TX on the radio being up, and feeds
caught-beacon events back to the scheduler. Conductor is exempt (gated on
`role == performer`). Toggle live with `powersave on|off` (persisted, NVS key
`ps`; default ON). The `[duty]` diag line reports `radio=ON/off` + `windows`/
`missed`.

**Bench result (conductor + duty-cycling performer, both DevKitC on USB):** radio
cycles ~0.6 s ON / ~4 s OFF as designed; **0% missed windows in steady state**
(every window catches a beacon and re-locks); the node free-runs the render across
each OFF with no blackout; wake reliably rebuilds the peer table (rx climbs across
sleeps); and the performer still appears in the conductor's `roster` (~10 s
cadence, mildly stretched because TX only happens during a window). The only
misses seen were transient, while the conductor itself was being reset during
setup. Note `gaps` increments ~once per wake (the first beacon after a 4 s sleep
has skipped seq numbers) — that's expected with duty-cycling and benign; the
`missed` counter is the meaningful health metric now, not `gaps`.

**SOLID boot-guard (same change):** a node never *boots* into `SOLID` (pattern 3,
full-white worst case) — `patternConfigLoad` falls a persisted SOLID back to
`SWEEP`, so a power-cycle can't leave a node draining the battery on all four
channels. `pattern 3` still works live for a deliberate on-bench measurement.

**Power result — MEASURED (2026-06-28, 12 V battery-side DMM, one DevKitC performer
locked to a beaconing conductor, steady-amber `GLOW` @ bri 48):**
- Radio **off** (rest, ~87% of the cycle): **51 mA @ 12 V**; radio **on** (the
  ~600 ms listen window, ~13%): **85 mA**. powersave-on **average ≈ 55 mA (~0.74 W
  @ 13.4 V)**; powersave-off pins the radio at the **85 mA** level (~1.14 W).
- Radio RX term = 85 − 51 ≈ **34 mA**; duty-cycling pays it only ~13% of the time
  → **saves ~30 mA @ 12 V (~0.4 W), ~35% of node draw.** The always-on 85 mA
  matches the original go/no-go's ~83 mA baseline (rigs agree).
- **Battery life (138 Wh, 10 h/night): ~12 → ~19 nights (~1.5×);** 24/7 calendar
  ~5 → ~7.8 days.
- **Why ~1.5× and not more:** the saving is a *fixed* ~30 mA radio term, but the
  ~51 mA rest floor (LEDs + CPU) now dominates, so the duty-cycle % scales inversely
  with LED load — a bigger win on dim shows. **Radio is no longer the dominant
  term;** the next levers are LED brightness, Stage B (CPU light-sleep to cut the
  floor), and Lever 2 (daytime deep-sleep).
- A *dim/5 V-side* sanity run under pulsing-white earlier showed the radio blip
  clearly (off-floor 0.05 A vs on 0.09–0.17 A); consistent with the above.

Measurement gotcha confirmed: do the battery reading with **USB disconnected**
(USB backfeeds 5 V into the DevKit and corrupts the 12 V draw) — powersave persists
in NVS, so set the mode over serial, then unplug and read. And never leave a USB
power meter inline on the data path (corrupts the UART / browns out radio init —
cost us a session; see FLASHING.md).

**A new show pattern landed alongside this:** `GLOW` (`pattern 4`) — a steady solid
color at a fixed hue, no time term, so the field holds one calm color with a *flat*
(non-pulsing) draw. `params[0]` = hue degrees (30 orange / 40 amber / 50 yellow),
`params[1]` = saturation %. Used as the realistic-conservative power-test scene; also
a genuine warm/gentle show pattern. Host test covers the warm-hue color math (39
tests now).

**INA228 power telemetry — CODE-COMPLETE 2026-07-04, host-tested (65 native
tests green), both device envs build — NOT hardware-verified (chip arrives with
Monday's order).** ARCHITECTURE §4.2. Reviewed same day (8-angle /code-review,
10 verified candidates → 4 fixes applied: avg-W plausibility bound, time-gate
before the spinlock in maybePowerReport, PowerSample embedded in PowerMsg,
conductor self-log on the tested scheduler). What landed:
- `include/powermon.h` (pure, 7 host tests): J→Wh / C→mAh / avg-W conversions,
  a plausibility gate (NaN/inf/orders-of-magnitude nonsense gets logged but
  flagged `** IMPLAUSIBLE`, never trusted into the budget — including the
  reboot-inflated avg-W case: accumulator survives an ESP32 reset while the
  elapsed anchor restarts, so a whole night's Joules over seconds would read
  as kW; the gate bounds avg at 50 W), and the report scheduler (fires only
  while the radio is up + conductor peer exists, catches up with exactly ONE
  report after a long radio-off span — no bursts).
- Wire: `MSG_POWER` unicast performer→conductor on the existing REGISTER path;
  the payload IS the embedded `PowerSample` struct (one field list, sender and
  receiver can't drift; byte-identical layout — all members 4-byte aligned).
  **No PROTO_VERSION bump** — new type only; v2 receivers without the handler
  ignore it via the dispatch default. The peer-add logic is now shared
  (`conductorPeerReady`).
- Glue (`main.cpp`): I2C probe at boot (`Wire` on SDA 21 / SCL 22; a node
  without the chip fails the probe in ~ms and stays silent — one image
  everywhere). **`begin(..., skipReset=true)` is load-bearing:** the chip stays
  battery-powered across an ESP32 reset, and the lib's default begin()
  hardware-resets it — which would wipe the night's Wh the moment a serial
  monitor's DTR auto-reset hits. Zeroing is only ever explicit (`power reset`).
  Continuous conversion mode is set explicitly (triggered mode invalidates the
  hardware accumulators). Conductor drains reports from a spinlocked queue and
  logs `[power] <mac> E=… Wh avg=… W Q=… mAh V=… I=… (elapsed)` — ungated by
  the serial-activity window (it IS the overnight audit log). A conductor
  carrying the chip logs its own line on the same 60 s cadence.
- Caveat (documented in the code): `elapsed_s` restarts on reboot while the
  chip keeps accumulating, so after an unplanned mid-night reboot the energy
  total is still right but avg-W overstates until the next `power reset`.
- Overnight flow: `power reset` at dusk → run untethered → morning: reconnect
  USB and read with the **no-reset pyserial trick** (FLASHING.md) *or* just
  read the conductor's scrollback; a DTR reset no longer zeroes the chip, only
  the elapsed anchor.

**INA228 bench checklist (Monday, chip in hand):** (1) wire VCC→3V3, GND→GND,
SDA→21, SCL→22, shunt in series battery+ → buck input; (2) boot log shows
`[power] INA228 found`; `info` shows `ina228=yes`; (3) `power` prints a sane
line (V≈13.4, I≈55 mA on the GLOW scene); (4) cross-check E against the DMM/
ET900 over ~30 min; (5) confirm a `[power]` report lands in the conductor log
~every 60 s with powersave on (deferred through radio-off spans); (6) DTR-reset
the node mid-run and confirm E survives (only elapsed resets); (7) `power
reset` then verify E climbs from 0.

**Code layout:** `include/` — `config.h` (pins/constants), `beacon.h` (wire
packets), `sync.h` (clock core, tested), `pattern_math.h` (pure pattern fns,
tested), `patterns.h` (LED binding), `roster.h` + `table.h` (pure, tested),
`table_wire.h` (table chunking / validation / broadcast cadence, pure, tested),
`powersave.h` (radio duty-cycle schedule, pure, tested), `powermon.h` (INA228
telemetry logic, pure, tested), `macaddr.h` (MAC text parse/format, pure,
tested), `bootplan.h` (Lever-2 boot classification, pure, tested), `identity.h`
(NodeIdentity). `src/main.cpp`
is the on-device glue. NVS namespace is `"node"` (keys: `id`, `x`, `y`, `role`,
`pat`/`bri`/`p0`..`p3` for the pattern, `table` blob on the conductor).

**Not built yet:** Pi packaging (AP hotspot, mDNS, systemd, serial device naming),
auto-calibration, show program / scheduling, real identify blink over ESP-NOW,
OTA transfer. (The OTA safety foundation — build/version reporting and mixed
firmware detection — is built; structured machine serial and the dev laptop
UI/API are built now; INA228 telemetry firmware IS built too — see the section
above; it awaits the physical chip.)

## Hardware state

- 3× DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1, all on the unified image. Rings on 2 of them; LED data
  on **GPIO13 (`D13`)**, USB 5V (no 12 V / buck yet).
- **As of 2026-07-05 (live API checked on `http://127.0.0.1:8001` after flashing v3):**
  - `/dev/cu.usbserial-7`, `8C:94:DF:57:7F:14` — **CONDUCTOR**, serial-backed
    API server currently attached here.
  - `8C:94:DF:8F:71:50` — performer, label `#1`, positioned at approximately
    `(0.2249, 0.7570)`.
  - `30:76:F5:93:67:3C` — performer, label `#2`, positioned at approximately
    `(0.8076, 0.4122)`.
  - Current live state when this doc was updated: `summary.alive=2`,
    `summary.total=2`, `attention=0`, pattern `Glow`, brightness `27`,
    params `[50,100,0,0]` (`hue=50`, `saturation=100`), firmware
    `build_label=c046bf54`, `dirty=false`, `summary.firmware.consistent=true`
    with `2 / 2` performers matching.
- Port names still shuffle because all boards report the same USB serial —
  re-check each board with `info` rather than trusting labels.
- **Gotcha:** factory boards ship with ESP-AT firmware and need a one-time
  `esptool.py --port <P> erase_flash` before our image runs right. Boards report
  the same USB serial, so port names shuffle on replug — flash by current port.
  Full details in `FLASHING.md`.

**Power — battery go/no-go MEASURED (2026-06-28): GO (nighttime).** Wired the real
battery → buck → node chain (12 Ah LiFePO4 at 13.43 V → UCTRONICS 9–36V→5V buck →
DevKit performer + pulsing ring) and measured the **12V input** current with a DMM
in series. **Loaded draw ~83 mA → ~1.11 W total, converter included**; buck idle
(no board) 8.7 mA ≈ 0.12 W; **converter efficiency ~77%** (load = 0.855 W full-hour
ET900 integral ÷ 1.11 W input; UCTRONICS is fine — keep it). **~11 Wh/night →
138 Wh ÷ 1.11 W ≈ ~12 nights** at 10 h/night, clears the 10-night target. The
5V-side ET900 reading was the *load only* (0.855 W); this 12V number is
authoritative. Caveats: (1) **calendar life still needs
daytime deep-sleep** — at 24/7 it's ~5 days, under a 10-night event. The photodiode
sets the duty cycle: at BRC (BM 2026 = Aug 30–Sep 7, ~40.8 °N) darkness is ~11 h
sunset→sunrise, so a dusk-tripped LDR runs **~10–10.5 h on / ~13.5 h asleep** —
the 10 h/night assumption holds; use 10.5 h for the post-M3 recompute (math in the
`power-budget-go-no-go` memory); (2) radio
likely dominates the draw — **modem-sleep is ineffective in connectionless ESP-NOW**
(`WIFI_PS_MIN_MODEM` set, CPU 160 MHz, but no AP/DTIM so RX stays on); the real
lever is **scheduled light-sleep between beacons** (synced clock enables it), the
Milestone-3 power item; (3) **FireBeetle** would draw less still. Full math in the
`power-budget-go-no-go` memory.

**Worst-case measured (2026-06-28, ET900 @ 5V):** `SOLID` (`pattern 3`) at
`bri 255` — every pixel full RGBW white — drew **0.76 A @ 5V = 3.8 W → ~4.6 W @ 12V
→ ~3 nights sustained** (~4× the colored show, since white lights all 4 channels).
**Battery GO holds** — even pathological all-white never fails in one night, and
0.76 A is well inside the buck/USB limits (so the cap is policy, not safety).
Decision: **`MAX_BRIGHTNESS = 192`** keeps worst case ~3.8 nights while barely
dimming real shows. Watts are fine; the gating issue is *hours* → daytime sleep.

---

**⚠ `main.cpp` global-ordering pitfall (for future edits):** NVS helpers must be
defined *below* the global they touch. `patternConfigLoad/Save` sit *after*
`g_beacon`; `tableLoad/Save` need `g_table`, which is declared up top with the
other config globals for exactly this reason. Don't move these loads into
`configLoad()` or forward-declare the globals — a prior attempt broke the build.

## Pilot batch: ORDERED 2026-07-03 (receipts in `receipts/`)

The **`docs/BOM.md` → "Pilot batch (5–7 units)"** order went out 2026-07-03,
across three carts (~$732 incl. tax/shipping):
- **DFRobot** — 6× FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E, $57 (invoice `366209`).
- **Adafruit** — 4× SK6812 **RGBW** rings (PID 2855, Natural White) + **2×
  INA228** total across two invoices (`3705934`, `3705946`). The first invoice
  was a mis-order (**RGB** PID 1463 rings) corrected 33 min later — ⚠ **confirm
  the RGB order was cancelled/refunded.** 2 INA228s is fine (plan is 1–2
  instrumented reference nodes).
- **Amazon** (`111-8959596-4536221`, $600.40) — 5× TalentCell LF120A1 batteries
  (arriving Jul 10), 3× buck 2-packs, CanaKit Pi 3 B+ kit, preloaded Pi OS SD
  card, 74AHCT125 10-pack, perfboard 30-pack, PT334-6C phototransistors,
  resistor kit, 1000 µF caps, toggle switches, plus beyond-BOM extras: 5× IP65
  junction boxes, grommet kit, silicone sealant, and a 150 A inline power
  analyzer. Most of it arriving Mon Jul 6.

**Follow-ups from the receipts:**
- ⚠ **The battery line is on Subscribe & Save ("every 2 weeks") — cancel the
  subscription after the first delivery** or it re-ships 5 batteries (~$220)
  every two weeks.
- Ordered **5 batteries / 4 RGBW rings**, not 6 — the 6th node is covered by
  already-owned bench hardware (2 rings are mounted on the DevKitC boards).
- **Not ordered anywhere: JST-SM connector kit and fuse holders + fuses** (BOM
  pilot rows 10–11) — add to a future cart before field wiring.

## Milestone 3 detail — power management (Stage A measured, Stage B verified, Lever 2 awaiting sensors; next-session order is at the top of this doc)

**Lever 1 Stage A (performer radio duty-cycle) is done, hardware-verified, measured,
and pushed** (`main` @ `5089d33`) — see the bench result near the top. It cut node
draw ~35% (85 → ~55 mA @ 12 V, ~12 → ~19 nights). **The radio is no longer the
dominant term.**

**Power budget now breaks into three roughly co-equal terms** (measured @ 5 V on a
DevKitC): **CPU + board ~50 mA** (incl. the DevKit's power LED + CP2102 USB chip),
**LEDs ~50 mA** (amber `GLOW` @ bri 48), **radio RX ~70 mA when on** (now paid only
~13% of the time). So the remaining levers, roughly in impact order:
1. **CPU floor** — the largest *constant* draw now. Attacked by Stage B and, more
   powerfully, by **scheduled-wake + deep-sleep for static scenes** (next section).
2. **LED brightness** — pure policy knob.
3. **Daytime deep-sleep (Lever 2)** — the calendar-life fix (24/7 is still ~5 days).

⏳ **Quick measurement still owed:** the CPU floor above was read *through USB*, which
includes CP2102 + power-LED overhead absent on battery. Re-measure `bri 0` rest on
the **12 V battery rig, USB disconnected** for the true MCU floor before sizing the
sleep work. (FireBeetle, the M4 candidate, has a lower quiescent draw and shrinks
this floor further.)

**INA228 precision power monitor: firmware DONE (2026-07-04)** (see the
"INA228 power telemetry" section above, `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` readout-path
section, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.2) — an I2C breakout with hardware
energy/charge accumulation, wired in series between battery+ and the buck
input on 1–2 reference nodes. It replaces one-off ET900/DMM snapshots with a
true continuous Wh integral per night, and instrumented performers report
accumulated Wh to the conductor over ESP-NOW (`MSG_POWER`) so every overnight
sync test doubles as a fleet-wide power audit. Awaiting the physical chip
(Monday's order) — the bench checklist is in the section above.

### Lever 1 (do first): radio off between beacons — performer-only

**Why it works:** a performer free-runs `f(x,y,t)` from the synced clock, so it does
*not* need continuous RX — only periodic beacons for clock-drift correction and
pattern/table updates. So turn the radio **off** most of the time and wake it briefly
to resync. This attacks the dominant RX term (modem-sleep can't, see power note).
**Conductor is exempt** — it must beacon every 250 ms (TX), and is typically
wall-powered; gate all of this on `role == performer`.

**Staged plan:**
- **Stage A — radio duty-cycle, CPU stays on. ✅ DONE + host-tested +
  hardware-verified + measured + pushed.** `include/powersave.h` + glue in
  `main.cpp`; `powersave on|off` toggles it live (NVS `ps`, default on); `[duty]`
  diag. Implementation notes preserved in §8.1 / the commit. The one thing *not*
  worth doing: widening `DUTY_OFF_US` (4 s → 8 s/60 s) — at 13% duty we already
  removed ~30 of the ~34 mA radio term, so a 60 s wake saves only ~4 mA more while
  multiplying pattern-update latency. Diminishing returns; leave it at 4 s.
- **Stage B — cut the CPU floor (now the biggest constant term). ✅ HARDWARE-VERIFIED
  (2026-07-03 bench, conductor + 2 performers, all on protocol v2): naps run
  ~2/s on GLOW (heartbeat-capped ~0.5 s each), measured slept time tracks wall
  clock (~87–93% of each radio-off span asleep) — `esp_timer` IS compensated
  across light sleep, the known risk is retired; sync stays `LOCKED` with
  `missed=0` across hundreds of naps; UART wake + serial grace + diag gating
  all behave as designed. One glue fix found on the bench: light sleep releases
  the UART0 TX pad and sprayed a junk byte per transition at the host —
  `gpio_hold_en(GPIO_NUM_1)` across the sleep eliminates it (verified 0 junk
  bytes post-fix). Power re-measure on the 12 V rig still owed. ⚠ Watch item:
  the conductor board (8C:94:DF:57:7F:14, the one that needed today's
  `erase_flash` for the FLASHING.md clock-scramble) once flooded serial with
  diag lines at full baud with `seq` racing (time-gated timers firing every
  loop) — cleared by reset, not reproducible after retrying the same command
  sequence; if it recurs, suspect this board's hardware first.** What landed: `include/napsched.h`
  (pure `napPlan()` — how long may the CPU light-sleep right now; 9 host tests)
  + `include/pattern_ids.h` (PatternId enum extracted from Arduino-bound
  patterns.h so `patternIsStatic` is host-reachable) + glue in `main.cpp`
  (replaces the `delay(16)` loop tail). Behavior: naps happen only on a
  performer with `powersave on` and **only while the radio is already off**
  (never into a listen window); a nap ends at the earliest of the next radio
  duty transition, the next ~30 fps frame (animated patterns only — GLOW/SOLID
  skip this and sleep clear through), the next heartbeat edge (keeps the GPIO2
  sync blink square), or a 1 s safety cap. Serial safety: any serial byte holds
  naps off for 30 s, a UART wakeup (typing at a sleeping node — hit Enter once,
  then type) does the same, and boot seeds the grace so a fresh flash has a
  provisioning window. Glue details: waits for the RMT LED transfer +
  `Serial.flush()` before sleeping (sleep truncates both), knobs in config.h
  (`NAP_*`, `SERIAL_NAP_GRACE_US`).
  **Bench checklist for the next hardware session:** (1) `[nap]` diag —
  `slept` should track wall time (measured via esp_timer delta; **slept≈0 with a
  climbing nap count means esp_timer is NOT compensated across light sleep**,
  the known Stage-B risk — fix would be adding slept RTC time back); (2) sync
  must stay `LOCKED`, `missed=0`, offset stable across naps; (3) heartbeat still
  square @ 1 Hz; (4) serial: confirm Enter-then-type works on a napping node;
  (5) re-measure the 12 V USB-disconnected draw on GLOW — expect the ~50 mA
  CPU floor to drop meaningfully; compare `powersave on` vs `off`.
  Original design notes (kept for context) — two flavors, gated on whether the
  current scene is animated:
  - **Animated patterns (pulse/sweep/drift):** CPU must re-render ~20–30 Hz, so the
    play is **light-sleep between rendered frames**. SK6812 latch their last color,
    so LEDs hold during the nap. Harder part: verify whether `esp_timer`/systimer
    advances across `esp_light_sleep_start()` — if not, add the slept RTC duration
    back or synced time drifts.
  - **Static scenes (`GLOW` and any constant `f`):** the LEDs hold with the MCU
    fully asleep, so the node can **deep/light-sleep for the whole inter-wake
    interval** — attacking the radio *and* CPU floor at once, down toward LED-only
    draw. This is the **"scheduled-wake" protocol idea** (below) and is the single
    biggest remaining win for calm shows.

**Scheduled-wake + deep-sleep protocol (design thread, not yet built):** because
every node shares the synced clock, instead of each performer waking on its own
~4.6 s timer, have them **all wake at a shared wall-clock boundary** (e.g. each
synced-time minute), the conductor **bursts the current pattern during that window**,
nodes catch it and sleep again. No "subscribe" handshake is needed — ESP-NOW is
broadcast and the shared clock *is* the coordination. The real prize isn't more
radio savings (Stage A already got those) but that a known next-wake time lets a
node **deep-sleep between windows on static scenes** (LEDs latched), and it makes
Lever 2's deep-sleep/rejoin coherent. Costs to design around: pattern/show updates
land up to one wake-interval late (fine for a programmed show, painful for live
tuning), and each window gets more critical (miss → longer free-run + delayed
update; mitigate with a longer burst + the conductor repeating it).

**Drift budget (still holds):** free-running tens of seconds on the last offset is
<~5 ms relative drift (crystals ~tens of ppm) — invisible on the slow patterns, so
minute-scale wake intervals are fine for *timekeeping*; the limiter is update
latency, not sync.

### Lever 2 (then): schedule-driven deep-sleep — calendar life

**Primary path as of 2026-07-05:** the conductor broadcasts runtime
`PowerPolicy` in every v5 beacon. Operations sets the radio/light-sleep check
interval, deep-sleep check interval, LED-on window, and force-awake override.
Performers clear LEDs and deep-sleep outside the window, then wake on the
configured check cadence to hear whether the schedule/override changed. This
makes the photodiodes redundant for the main installation path.

The photodiode dusk detector below remains off by default as an optional
fallback/experiment, not the plan of record.

**🛠 CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-03), host-tested (57 native tests green), both device
envs build — NOT hardware-verified (needs the pilot phototransistors, arriving);
DEFAULT OFF (`dusk on|off`, NVS `dusk`) because GPIO34 floats until the sensor
is wired.** What landed: `include/dusk.h` (pure debounced day/night detector
with hysteresis + the deep-sleep gate; 9 host tests) + glue in `main.cpp` +
config knobs (`DUSK_*`; thresholds are placeholders to bench-calibrate).

**Design principle: FAIL AWAKE** — every ambiguous case resolves to staying
awake; the only possible failure mode is battery drain, never an unreachable
field. Four independent layers guarantee daytime testability:
1. **`wake on|off` (conductor, NVS-sticky)** sets `BEACON_FLAG_FIELD_AWAKE` in
   every beacon. A dusk-sleeping node wakes every **15 min** (`DUSK_RESAMPLE_US`)
   and listens for a beacon before it may re-sleep — a flagged beacon pins it
   awake (60 s TTL, continuously refreshed). Summon latency for the whole field:
   ≤ one resample interval. Historical note: this originally grew the wire format
   to `PROTO_VERSION 2`; the current protocol is **v5**, and every protocol bump
   still means reflashing every board together.
2. **Any power-cycle boots awake** (cold boot starts in "night", won't dusk-sleep
   for 10 min, 60 s light debounce on top). Per-lantern physical override via the
   battery toggle switch — no firmware bug can remove it.
3. **`dusk` is default OFF** — nothing sleeps until deliberately enabled after
   the pilot proves it (INA228 watching).
4. **Fail-awake invariants:** deep sleep is only entered via `duskEnterDeepSleep()`
   which arms the RTC wake timer atomically (`esp_deep_sleep`); implausible light
   readings (outside `[20, 3100] mV` — floating/broken sensor) read as *night*;
   serial traffic holds sleep off 5 min; all host-tested.

Mechanics: 1 Hz ADC sampling; flip day↔night only after 60 s continuously past
the far hysteresis threshold (clouds/headlights/flashlights reset the stretch);
timer wakes start in "day" via an RTC-memory flag and re-sleep in ~10 s if still
bright; dusk arrival flips to night and the show starts. `[dusk]` diag line +
light/vbat in `info` (VBAT divider read landed too — reported only, no cutoff
policy yet). Daytime cost at 15-min cadence ≈ ~1% duty → ~0.15 Wh/day, noise.
**Bench checklist:** calibrate `DUSK_DAY_MV`/`DUSK_NIGHT_MV` (+ polarity
`DUSK_DAY_ABOVE`) against the real divider; verify deep-sleep current (~10 µA
class); verify a full sleep→timer-wake→re-sleep cycle and `wake on` summoning;
verify a cold boot never sleeps for 10 min.

Original design notes: fixes the 24/7 ~5-day problem by sleeping through daylight. **Light sensor on
`PIN_LDR` = GPIO34 (ADC1 — ADC2 dies with the radio, already reserved in config.h).**
User leans toward a **photodiode/phototransistor** (faster than an LDR; an LDR in a
divider also works for a coarse threshold — pick by what's on hand). Below a light
threshold for a debounce → `esp_deep_sleep` (~10 µA), waking on an RTC timer to
re-sample (e.g. every ~30 min) or sleeping a fixed span until expected dusk. Add the
**battery ADC on `PIN_VBAT` = GPIO35** (divider) to report voltage + low-batt cutoff.

### Self code-review (2026-07-03) — fixes landed + known debt

A full-repo adversarial review (8 finder angles) ran after Stage B + Lever 2.
**Fixed + tested + committed:** (1) the stale-RTC-day trap — a dusk node
timer-waking after sunset re-slept every 15 min all night; `duskShouldSleep`
now refuses while live samples disagree with the day state (`d.cand != d.day`,
host-tested); (2) re-issued `powersave on` during a radio-off span stranded the
radio off permanently (now radioWake()s first; espnowStart also tolerates
double-init); (3) serial `pattern`/`bri`/`param` raced the recv callback's
`g_beacon` overwrite (now mutate+snapshot under `g_sync_mux`, NVS-save from the
snapshot); (4) role switches left a stale duty schedule (role command now
re-inits the duty machine); (5) `missed_windows` overcounted (beacon credit now
runs before `dutyStep` in loop()); (6) static patterns no longer re-render at
60 Hz (pattern-change detection + 1 Hz safety refresh); (7) diag prints only
within 5 min of serial activity — **hit Enter on a monitor to revive a quiet
node's diag** (headless nodes no longer burn ~13 ms/s of UART drain).

**Debt PAID 2026-07-04 (the review-debt session):**
- ✅ **Field build envs** `field-devkitc` / `field-firebeetle` (`extends` the
  bench envs + `-D HEARTBEAT_LED=0`; see "Build envs" near the top and
  FLASHING.md's env table).
- ✅ **Table rebroadcast stretched** 5 s → 60 s steady-state backstop
  (`TABLE_INTERVAL_US`); targeted delivery is a **single-row MSG_TABLE reply
  (23 B, broadcast)** to any REGISTER from a node that is *new to the roster
  or unprovisioned (id 0)* — sent while that node's radio is provably up (it
  just transmitted), retried for free by its next REGISTER, zero table traffic
  in steady state. `assign` still broadcasts the full table immediately.
- ✅ **Host-unreachable logic extracted + tested** (83 total):
  `parseMac`/`macStr` → `macaddr.h` (parseMac rejects trailing garbage — a
  pasted EUI-64 must not silently truncate to its prefix MAC); `broadcastTable`
  chunk math, MSG_TABLE length validation, own-row scan, and the row-reply
  decision/builder → `table_wire.h`; the Lever-2 boot classification →
  `bootplan.h` (the seed now pre-expires `max(dusk, nap)` serial grace, so the
  old unlabeled `DUSK_SERIAL_GRACE_US > SERIAL_NAP_GRACE_US` invariant is
  *gone*, not just labeled); the SOLID boot-guard → `patternBootSafe` in
  `pattern_ids.h`.

**Same-day adversarial review of the paydown (8 finder angles + 1-vote
verify, 10 findings, 7 CONFIRMED) — all fixed the same day:** the first
cadence design (burst on new-MAC, inferred from a roster count change) had
three confirmed delivery holes — a reflashed node (known MAC, wiped NVS) never
got a burst and waited ~5-8 min for its position; a full roster (never pruned,
64 slots vs 60 nodes + swaps) silently suppressed the burst; and a burst
deferred by the 2 s rate limit could fire into the requester's radio-off gap
with no retry. The row-reply design above replaced it (simpler AND covers all
three: reply keyed on pre-upsert known-ness + id, not on count inference; no
hold-off to miss). Also fixed from the review: `parseMac` trailing-garbage
acceptance (empirically confirmed — `forget <EUI-64 paste>` would have
operated on the wrong lantern), the `role` round-trip resuming a stale table
schedule (now file-scope `g_next_table_us`, zeroed on role change), FLASHING.md
missing the field-* envs, and the field envs copy-pasting instead of
`extends`-ing the bench envs.

**Known debt (deliberate, not yet done):**
- Dead wire artifacts: `palette_id` unused, `MSG_ROSTER`/`MSG_ACK` unsent,
  `TableMsg.chunk/chunks` written but never read. Removing the wire fields would
  change layout → PROTO_VERSION bump → reflash every board together; fold it
  into the next deliberate protocol rev instead of doing it standalone. Roster
  firmware reporting is no longer dead: v5 REGISTER includes `fw` + release
  version + build id + dirty flag for OTA consistency checks, and BEACON includes
  runtime `PowerPolicy`.

### After Milestone 3
Milestone 4 — battery enclosure + final go/no-go on the **FireBeetle** (lower draw
than the DevKit). Then the non-power tracks still open: auto-calibration (§6),
Pi web UI / control plane (§5.2, needs the deferred machine serial), show program
(§4.1). Milestone 5 — OTA + enclosure.
